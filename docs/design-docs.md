# Design Documentation

This directory contains design documentation that provides guidance for future development and testing practices.

## Table of Contents

1. [Test Organization Patterns](./testing/test-organization.md) - Organizing tests with classes and shared test infrastructure
2. [Dependency Injection in Tests](./testing/dependency-injection.md) - Using pytest fixtures for dependency injection
3. [Mocking Strategies](./testing/mocking-strategies.md) - Mocking AWS services and error states
4. [Test Parameterization](./testing/test-parameterization.md) - Using pytest.mark.parametrize for comprehensive test coverage
5. [Error Assertion Patterns](./testing/error-assertion.md) - Best practices for asserting error messages

## Overview

These design patterns represent established practices for:

- Organizing and structuring test code
- Managing dependencies and test fixtures
- Mocking external services and error conditions
- Writing maintainable and comprehensive tests
- Asserting error conditions properly

Each document includes code examples that are generic enough to guide future development while being specific enough to be actionable.
